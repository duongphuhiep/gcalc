# General Calculator

[about](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duongphuhiep/gcalc/master/Help/screenshoot/about.png)

One of my old project since my last year high school on summer 2012. An advance calculator tailored for Vietnamese High School Students to prepare for University Math exams:
- Graphs drawer
- Matrix calculator
- Solve any `f(x)=0` equation
- Logic
- Date Time (include Vietnamese calendar)

Developed with Borland Delphi 7 (turn to Embarcadero Delphi on 2015), ~7000 lines of codes (~300 working hours)

The parser convert expression into the [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), then evaluate the expression over 87 built-in functions and operators. See [help.pdf in Vietnamese](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duongphuhiep/gcalc/master/Helphttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/duongphuhiep/gcalc/master/Help.pdf). 

Unfortunately, I have no time to translate or maintance this projects. But it is still fully functional on Windows 7 (since 12 years).

# Installation

I also published the [Relase pack](/Releases). 
* [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duongphuhiep/gcalc/master/Releases/GCalc.zip) 
* unzip 
* run `GCalc.exe`
* read [Help (in Vietnamese)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duongphuhiep/gcalc/master/Helphttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/duongphuhiep/gcalc/master/Help.pdf) 

and you're ready to go..
